This Project consists of three subparts:
1. Two player chess game that can be played over a local network
2. An encrypted chat platform by which players can communicate
3. A tool which sends images over network

For efficiency, both the chat messages and images will be compressed before sending.


To run the game run server.py and then run two instances of game.py.

To run the chat platform run chat_server.py and then chat_client.py.

To run the file sender run image_server.py and then image_client.py.
